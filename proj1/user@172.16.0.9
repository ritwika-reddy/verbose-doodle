	This is a buffer oveflow attack, a check is not being performed right ?

	than BUFFER_SIZE. If it is not, there is a possibility that the strcpy operation 
	can overwrite the return address and also it can inject some code onto the stack,
	and since the stack has not been made non-executable, the injected code can be 
	executed if the return address is pointed to that.
